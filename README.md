# Marketplace Ranking Booster

## Project Overview

**Marketplace Ranking Booster** is a cutting-edge web application designed to help businesses elevate their products to rank #1 in organic search results on popular marketplaces like **Bol.com**, **Kaufland**, and more. By leveraging advanced automation, analytics, and optimization techniques, this tool enables sellers to maximize visibility, increase traffic, and drive more sales for their products.

The application is built using the following core technologies:

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** A utility-first CSS framework for building fast, custom, and responsive user interfaces.
- **[Puppeteer-Extra](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra):** An extended version of Puppeteer that includes additional plugins for stealth mode, automation enhancements, and browser feature extensions.
- **[ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/):** A WebDriver for Chrome, enabling fast and precise browser automation.
- **[Node.js Express](https://expressjs.com/):** A minimalist, high-performance web framework for Node.js, providing a scalable backend for web applications.
- **[Bablosoft Fingerprint](https://fp.bablosoft.com/):** Advanced browser fingerprinting technology for simulating human-like behavior and ensuring undetectable automation.

## Bablosoft Fingerprint and Proxy Configuration

### Bablosoft Fingerprint

Marketplace Ranking Booster uses **[Bablosoft Fingerprint](https://fp.bablosoft.com/)** to ensure advanced browser fingerprinting for undetectable automation. This allows the application to mimic real-world user behavior effectively.

To configure Bablosoft Fingerprint, include the library in your Puppeteer setup:

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-extra');
const FingerprintPlugin = require('puppeteer-extra-plugin-fingerprint');
const fingerprintData = require('./fingerprint.json'); // Exported fingerprint data from Bablosoft

// Use the fingerprint plugin
puppeteer.use(FingerprintPlugin({ fingerprint: fingerprintData }));

const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
```

Export fingerprint data from Bablosoft and include it in your project as `fingerprint.json` for seamless integration.

### Proxy Configuration

Proxies can be configured alongside Bablosoft Fingerprint to ensure anonymity and facilitate regional targeting. Update the proxy settings in the configuration file (`config.js`):

```javascript
const PROXY_SERVER = 'http://your-proxy-server:port';
const PROXY_USERNAME = 'your-username';
const PROXY_PASSWORD = 'your-password';

module.exports = { PROXY_SERVER, PROXY_USERNAME, PROXY_PASSWORD };
```

Integrate the proxy into Puppeteer:

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: [`--proxy-server=${PROXY_SERVER}`],
});

const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.authenticate({
  username: PROXY_USERNAME,
  password: PROXY_PASSWORD,
});
```
